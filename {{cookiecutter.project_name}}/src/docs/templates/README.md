Use this folder to store templates to modify the generated documentation. The templates are written in Jinja2 and are used to generate the HTML documentation for the schema.

The default templates are stored in the linkml repository at https://github.com/linkml/linkml/tree/main/linkml/generators/docgen. If you want to use these as a starting point, you can copy them into this folder and modify them as needed.
